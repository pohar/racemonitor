# Shared Memory API

This is a small sample application showing how to use the shared memory API for 
[RaceRoom Racing Experience][r3e] (R3E).

The sample will poll for RRRE.exe for ten minutes, and if/when it finds the
application it will print some of the live data for another ten minutes.

You'll find a JSON file with data lookup for the various car, track and livery
IDs in the [r3e-spectator-overlay][data] repository.


## Prerequisites

- [RaceRoom Racing Experience][r3e]
- _(sample-c)_ Any C89-compatible C/C++ compiler should be fine. There are
project files for Visual Studio 2010 and 2013 in the `build` directory. You can
download the free Community version of Visual Studio 2013 [here][vs2013].
- _(sample-csharp)_ The sample is targeted towards .NET 4.0, but might work with
earlier ones. There are build files for Visual Studio 2013 in the `build`
directory.
